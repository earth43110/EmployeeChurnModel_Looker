# Employee Churn Model using Looker

- Developed an Employee Churn Model using Looker Studio and BigQuery, leveraging a Random Forest algorithm to predict employees at risk of leaving based on key factors like job satisfaction, tenure, workload, and performance evaluations. The model revealed that job satisfaction is the most critical factor in retention, while work accidents had little impact on churn decisions. Insights from this analysis can help companies implement targeted retention strategies to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover.
